# Bruno Serra's Portfolio

## Intro

 As a senior student in Brazil, Bruno was selected to be part of the Brazilian Scientific Mobility Program which brought him to study at New York Institute of Technology as a non-degree international student (fully funded by the Brazilian government). Besides computers and technology, he is really passionate about design, UX and advertising. He believes that mixing up design, advertising and technology is the key for a successful and a differentiated career. Bruno specializes in the skills of PHP, Web Design and Photoshop.
